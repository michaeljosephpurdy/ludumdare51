Every 10 Seconds

## Background

My son is in 4th grade.
In 3rd grade, as well as in 4th grade, his class does math facts.
The concept is pretty straight forward:

> There are 100 math questions on a page
> Students have 4 minutes to complete as many questions as possible
> Students are graded by how many questions they answer correctly within the time limit
> 
> | grade        | skill              |
> |:-------------|:-------------------|
> | 100%         | Advanced (Mastery) |
> | 99-94        | Proficient         |
> | 93-80        | Basic              |
> | 79 and below | Below Basic        |

My son has a really, _really_, hard time with this.
The time limit sort of psychs makes him psych himself out.

I figured this may be a fun way for him to.

## Overview

The idea is that enemies will come at you, and you will have 10 seconds to gun them down by solving math facts.
